            		As a student on a budget traveling I quickly realized the best way into these foreign places would be through the sweet treats they had to offer. Oddly enough this made me feel like a rebelious child that had no one to tell them to stop consuming sugar.

The sunset was perfect, the ambiance was unbelievable there were musicians performing live as a bunch of us tourists collectively admired the beauty. Lisbon lived up to its hype about sunset watching. This was the best sunset watching experience I have ever had, it was straight out of a movie.
