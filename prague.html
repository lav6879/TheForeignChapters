        <p>I visited Prague in the company of my sister in law, after spending a few days in Paris with me we would head to Prague for my fall break. We were both incredibly excited. In hand we had reccomendations from her bestfriend who had visited two summers prior. He had told her it was wonderful and we were excited to experience it ourselves.</p>

                <p>I was most excited to frolic around the castle grounds and to visit the Kafka Museum. He is one of my favorite authors and I wanted to know more about him beyond the pages of his fiction. I was not aware that there would be so much iconography dedicated to him in the city such as the giant roatating head.</p>

                    Prague had so much more to offer. Ironically we found ourselves frustrated by its beauty, every corner we turned offered a breathtaking sight. Prague had an air of beautifully delicate eerieness.

                    Even its statues gave it an otherwordly feel, it was hard to feel like sights were getting repetitive. We even got to visit an animal conservatory where we saw a family of kangaroos, the baby kangaroo was peak cuteness. There was even an owl!
