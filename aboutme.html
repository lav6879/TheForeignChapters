				My project is an immersive digital story titled My Foreign Chapters, which I believe offers a unique and resonant experience. In a world of highly edited content, this project aims to deliver something different: a raw, intimate, and interactive journey about rediscovering the whimsy and wonder we often leave behind in childhood, all through the lens of my study abroad experience and future travels.

				My project is, on the surface, a travel journal. But at its heart, it is the story of finding my inner child again. I propose that the true value in travel is the opportunity to feel anew, much like children do as they encounter a world that is still unfamiliar and full of magic. As we travel, we step into new foreign microcosms that force us to learn how to navigate our environments all over again, like we once did as children. Studying abroad and traveling solo for the first time stripped away the routines of my young adult life and forced me to engage with the world with a new sense of vulnerability and curiosity. This narrative isn't just about the famous landmarks I saw; it's about the internal, emotional landscape I navigated. It’s about the sheer delight of getting purposefully lost, the powerful nostalgia of rediscovering a scent from my childhood in a foreign bakery, or the spontaneous decision to follow a side street just to see where it leads. I will build an interactive website where this story unfolds not in a straight line, but as a map of feelings and moments. Users can click on locations to view short video clips, audio recordings of my reflections, and photos, allowing them to explore the journey based on their own curiosity. The goal is to make them feel as if they are walking alongside me, sharing in both the exhilarating highs and the occasional lonely lows that come with being far from home.
