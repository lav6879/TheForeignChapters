	        <h1>The Heart of the Story</h1>
	        <p>We often think travel is about seeing famous landmarks. For me, its true magic was the chance to <em>feel</em> things anew—just like a child encountering a world that is still unfamiliar and full of magic.</p>
	        <br>
	        <p>Travel strips away our "adult" routines and forces us to navigate our environment with a fresh sense of vulnerability and curiosity. This story is about that internal journey.</p>

	        <h2>How to Explore</h2>
	        <p>This isn't a story that unfolds in a straight line. Instead, you’ll explore it through an <strong>interactive map of feelings and moments.</strong></p>
	        <p>Follow your own curiosity by clicking on different locations to unlock the story piece by piece and see my personal growth. </p>

	        <h2>Why It's Different</h2>
	        <p>In a world of highly edited and polished content, My Foreign Chapters offers something different. This is a deliberately <strong>raw and interactive journey</strong>. It’s an invitation to slow down, explore at your own pace, and perhaps be inspired to rediscover the magic in your own everyday world.</p>
