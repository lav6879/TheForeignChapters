					To be completely transparent, I was very reluctant to dive into my trip to Venice. I was originally supposed to go with my parents, and due to unforeseen circumstances turned into a last minute solo trip. This would have been my first solo trip EVER. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Venice had not even been among the destinations I was considering visiting during my time abroad. However, my parents shared a heartfelt story with me about how during the early stages of their relationship my mom made my dad promise to take her to Venice one day. Anticipating their company, we figured what better opportunity than now, their first time in Europe to make that promise a reality. So really I was the thrid wheel.</p>
				<br>
				<p>After finding out that they would not be joining me I considered skipping out on the trip altogether. It felt too soon and abrupt, I felt uneasy. However, I decided that it would be silly to let my reservations/tickets go to waste. With the broken promise in mind and the lack of company from my mom whose entire dream it was to visit Venice, I traveled with a heavy heart. </p>

				There were many signs telling me that I was not meant to go. Or maybe that was just me letting my fears and uncertainties dictate. For starters my flight was delayed, and then ultimately canceled as I was ready to board.

            	<p> Then the airline gave me the alternative to take a later flight that left from a completely different airport. That alternative flight also got delayed leading me to arrive in Venice past 12:00 AM or the next day. As a consequence, when I finally arrived at my stay it was closed for the night leaving me to panic thinking I had nowhere to sleep for the night all alone in Venice. Looking back on my trip to Venice, in spite of all the mishaps I am glad I went because it literally forced me to face my fears and figure it out. </p>
