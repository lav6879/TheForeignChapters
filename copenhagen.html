					At last I was not only in the company of my parents but also of my NYU New York roommate once more. I knew I was in for a treat. No danish cold or rain would rain on our parade.

				<p>This trip was a reminder of taking things slower. Sometimes my childlike wonder and eagerness can push me to want to eat the world in one bite. Upon arriving we grabbed something to eat and got to exploring the city, making sure to take our time to take it all in. My parents reminded that as much as I wanted to make the most out of my time in places, rushing myself to see it all would result in me not appreciating the individual places properly. </p>

            	<p>I adopted this mentality by choice, a choice made inevitable by the relentless rain and cold. However, it did not stop us in our tracks it just slowed us.</p>

            	<p>
            		I found myself making the most out of circumstances that were out of our hands, something I often forget to do as I enter adulthood. It reminded me how important doing so was. Much like a younger version of myself would not have thought twice about rain as an impediment. Instead of letting inconveniences ruin the moment, we laughed and found ways around.

            		In this case that meant wearing funny rain ponchos as we explored Copenhagen. It was a little ironic to take this lesson away in the happiest country in the world. Copenhagen felt like we were stepping into a fairy garden. The green spaces in the city were some of the nicest green spaces I've ever come accross. There were moments when it was easy to forget we were even in a city. They felt infinite and mythical all at once.

            	<p>My favorite part of this trip was Freetown Christiania. It was truly magical to see a self sustaining community that was so radical and open minded. In many ways it felt more advanced in its principles than a lot of other global modern cities. </p>
