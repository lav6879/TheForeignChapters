        	Still lucky enough to be accompanied by my parents, we booked train tickets from Valenica to Madrid for the day. At the time we did not know we would be doing ourselves a favor in running away from the rain. My dad

        	 and I had surprised my mom with the news. She has always mentioned having a cousin in Madrid who by that time she had not seen in over twenty years. This would be their chance to reunite.

            	<p> But first we did some sightseeing, taking in the sun we had been so deprived of. We all concurred that we were not expecting such large crowds. Madrid was bustling with tourists and locals that day. The city was having a celebration of hispanic heritage and it was the National Day of Spain. There were so many public events happening. </p>

            		We were very weary of the time, because we were really just making time for my mom's cousin to get out of work for the day. She was sweet enough to ask to be excused early to reunite with my mom. I was anxious for my mom, not knowing what to expect after so many years and so much physical distance.

            	<p>Once we were all together, my mom's cousin and her partner showed us around and made us try some traditional bites around town. </p>
            	<br>
            	<p>I was astonished by the ease with which they addressed one aother like no time had ever passed. It was beautifully heartwarming to see first-hand. I also found myself catching similarities between the two of them, the way their smiles formed or the way their noses moved when they smiled. There was no denying they were family.</p>

            		In the end, the sightseeing and the crowds faded into a blur. What remained was the profound lesson of that reunion: that time and distance are no match for the indelible stamp of family. Watching them talk and laugh, I saw that twenty years could collapse into twenty seconds, and that a shared history can make a foreign city feel, instantly, like a home you never knew you had. I cannot wait to stop to visit them in Madrid once more.
