            	<p>It was a place where we would be able to soak up the sun. Low and behold Mallorca did not let us down. It exceeded our expectations, it gave us not only the crystaline waters, but amazing views of the island's mountains and a charming city center. Our stay was near the airport which meant we had to take public transit into the city center anytime we wanted to go anywhere as the bus lines were very limited. Determined to explore as many coastal villages as we could we thrust ourselves into the unknown. </p>

During the four days we spent there we took advantage of the sea while basking in the sun, unintentionally hiked to some rewarding views, and savored delicious food and stunning architecture in the city center.</p>

            	<p>Looking back on the trips I've taken during my time abroad Mallorca stands firm as my favorite destination. It reminded me of the long, forgotten summers of childhood, where the only goal was to feel the sun on your skin and discover what lay around the next bend. I was a child again, captivated by the simple magic of a sunbeam. </p>
