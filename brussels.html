					My day-trip to Brussels came out of a decision to take advantage of the only NYU Paris sponsored trip outside of France. My goal this semester was to visit as many countries in Europe as possible, so this was the perfect opportunity. That also meant this would be my most structured trip. In the itinerary was visitng the Royal Museum for Central Africa and then the city center.

            	<p>As fascinating as the museum was with the help of Professor Atonucci's guidance. The highlight of Brussels was it's gastronomy. I do not think I have ever eaten as much in one day as I did during the Brussels trip.</p>
            	<br>
            	<p>For lunch alone, we had a "three" course meal which I would argue was really a four course meal. First a feta and spinach quiche, followed by a traditional beef stew, with a side of french fries and to finish off a belgian waffle. There was not one crumb left on my plates.</p>

            		After such a rich and heavy meal the only right thing to do was walk around the city center to walk off the food... of course stopping along the way to check out every chocolate shop we came across.

            		I would never consider myself a chocolate fan, but Brussels did something to me. It was like chocolate wonderland and nearly impossible to leave without trying some chocolate. It didn't help that every shop would offer us free tastings.
