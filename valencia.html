            	<p>While my parents were still in Europe, they too wanted to make the most of their time abroad and that meant visiting one more country before going back to New York City. There was no better feeling than seeing them be free, being taken out of their routine and daily stressors their inner childs came out too. They were playful and marveled at their new surroundings. We did not know what to expect going to Valencia, but I was optimistic after Mallroca. Especially hearing that it was the sunniest Spanish city.</p>

            		Little did we know the rain would follow us. We got to experience Valencia's once in a blue moon rains. Luckily we kept our rain ponchos from Copenhagen and this would be our second rodeo.

            	<br>
            	<p>We did the typical sightseeing, making sure to stop to take a break from the rain in the many indoor markets Valencia had to offer. We were all pleasently surprised by the diversity in Valencia's gastronomic landscape. I was even lucky enough to eat my first traditional Ecuadorian meal since I left NYC. </p>

            	<p>Somehow finding a spot to try the famous Paella which originates in Valencia became the hardest task during our time there. It seemed that thanks to the rain both tourists and locals alike decided to eat out, and most restaurants near our stay were packed, or pre-booked. </p>
            	<br>
            	<p>Just when we almost gave up, one spot opened its doors to use both as a refuge from the rain and to fill our bellies. The experience did not dissapoint, we were all glad we would be leaving Valencia having tried an authentic seafood Paella.</p>
