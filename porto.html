					After such a rewarding trip to Mallorca, I stepped into my second solo-trip with more optimism. I did not have any expectations for Porto, a lesson learned through Venice. With the exception of admiring its azulejos and peacocks.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Upon my initial arrival in Porto, I felt an odd sense of comfort by its semblance to my family's natal city in Ecuador, Cuenca. It was lovely yet not pristine, its charm was in its imperfections and homeyness.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Sticking true to my belief that the best way to explore a foreign place is through walking, I traversed the city by foot. I did not want to miss any part of it by taking public transit. From my list of places saved to on Google Maps, I prioritized the parks and gardens. I was dying to catch a peacock out and about. I also wanted to take in the city from above.

            		While I am not one for crowds, something about collectively admiring a city from a lookout point with a bunch of strangers from all over the world felt acceptable. With the vastness of the views it felt like there was room for all of us to enjoy. There was a touching beauty in people-watching strangers enjoying the simple pleasures of life.
            	</p>
            	<br>
            	<p>
            		I will admit though, there were moments where I found myself second guessing my "walking is best" policy. Porto was quite hilly and steep especially as I was walking with the intention of getting good views. In the end, the views made it all worth it.

            		I was not expecting to be blown away by the parks and gardens themselves, I thought the main attraction would be the views. Yet, in their layout the gardens felt truly out of a fairytale. Even the statues throughout the gardens made it feel all the more out of a storybook. I was immediately reminded of the Disney classic, Bambi.

            		Porto is holistically beautiful with its astoning azulejos, incomparable views, and fairytale charm. I felt like my childhood dream of experiencing the classic princess scene was coming true.
